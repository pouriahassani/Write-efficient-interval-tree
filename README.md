# Write-efficient-interval-tree
This is implementatio of a write efficient interval tree based on this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05592.pdf)

One can compile and run the code using `./run.sh` command in terminal. This will create a file named `input.txt` with a random set of intervals. After the crearing the tree it will also insert random intervals into tree. The number of the intervals are given as the input argumant in  the `bash.sh` file.

The query of the tree is not implemented.

The number of the writes is given as the output of the program
